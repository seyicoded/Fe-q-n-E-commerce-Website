                            <h3> <p>Secret of Longevity &amp; Proper Circulatory System. A Natural Cure for Hypertension. Kumar Gaurav:</p>  </h3>
                            
<p>Age is not an obstacle to your life! The 109 years cardiologist shared the secret of his longevity and excellent health</p>
<p>The renowned Nigerian cardiologist, Abraham Rastogi, retired at the age of 70, though he remained young in heart and body. He has already been retired for 39 years, and the Social Security authority hates him! Right now, the academia is 109 years, but he feels as if he were 60.@</p>
<p>Dr. Abraham says that the secret of the longevity relies in blood vessels . If they are clean and healthy, you can live up to 120 years. and even more, and feel completely healthy. The cardiologist completely confirmed this statement.</p>
<p>Dr. Abraham, who explained his life-prolonging method of cleansing the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Dr. Abraham, you often said that clean blood vessels are the basis for health. Why?</p>
<p>*It&apos;s simple. The functioning of the organs and systems in the body depends on the quality of the blood circulation. Blood circulation means delivering oxygen and nutrients to the internal organs, as well as collecting the carbon dioxide and metabolic products. In childhood, adolescence, youth, we move more, the vessels are new, elastic, clean - the nutrition of the organs is maximum. With age, we move less, and our vessels start to get dirty. This is because of many factors, not all detrimental (such as smoking, unhealthy eating, poor environment, sedentary lifestyle), but also natural (depositing of lipids, a process which takes places in all organisms).</p>
<p>What does &apos;dirty&apos; blood vessels mean? Imagine some pipes full of rust. What&apos;s going on? The pressure of the water increases and the water tastes bad. The same thing happens with the blood vessels. When cholesterol or other substances are deposited on them, the pressure increases ( the dirty vessels are the main cause for hypertension! ), the blood contains impurities, the blood circulation is deranged. As a result, changes take place in all the organs and systems of the body. Even the skin is a system.</p>
<p>As rhe human body gets older. If you are careful and you cleanse your blood vessels, you have the chance of living at least 20 years without pain in the organs or joint pain, and the body will work excellently. In other words, cleansing the blood vessels can prolong your life and health. And it is not just a theory. It is however recommended that this method to patients and should practice it personally to get adequate request. All who have heeded to the advice have excelled while those who are ignorant at the same age has suffered ill- health due to ignorance.</p>
<p>This is how the gradual dirt of the vessels takes place. If you have never cleansed your blood vessels and you are over 40 years old, they contain many impurities. This can affect your health, or maybe this process has already started.</p>
<p>*What kind of pathologies can the &apos;dirty&apos; blood vessels cause?</p>
<p>*The whole body suffers. But first of all, the organs and systems directly connected to the blood circulation are affected - the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>The impurities from the blood vessels can cause the appearance of the following diseases:</p>
<p>Atherosclerosis. The vessels stop functioning well: the small vessels are completely clogged, and the main ones contain high deposits of cholesterol.</p>
<p>The ischemic heart disease. It is caused by regular blood deficiency in the coronary vessels, which, in turn, develop because of the impurities from the vessels.</p>
<p>Stroke. The blood supply impairments in the cerebral tissue causes the death of the nervous endings, which leads to the loss of certain functions.</p>
<p>Hypertension. The impurities from the blood vessels cause the narrowing of the lumen and the increase of the blood pressure.</p>
<p>Varicose veins. They appear inside the body, not just on legs (which is alarming for women). The hemorrhoids are a consequence of the venous dilatation.</p>
<p>Venous and arterial thrombosis. The deposits of impurities from the blood vessels form thrombi and produce the death of the vessel, which can lead to the death of a group of cells from an organism. If the thrombus unbinds and gets into the blood stream, the blocking of the blood vessels in the heart may take place, and result in cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Products Testimonies : Ibrahim Adams,A</p>
<p>53 years man from Adamawa State. who suffered from stroke. The stroke leads him invalidity, these patient regular treatment with special care. After the process of the treatment he got fully recovered.The cause is the blocking of the blood vessels.</p>
<p>The varicose veins many women suffer from are also a direct consequence of the deposits in the vessels.</p>
<p>This situation is spreading. The cardiovascular diseases are responsible for 4 times more deaths than the other causes. The doctors are aware of this, they know the cleansing of the blood vessels is necessary, but for some reasons, the British medicine neglects this aspect. Most doctors prescribe remedies for decreasing the blood pressure in case of hypertension. It is necessary to cleanse the blood vessels. By the way, this method is has been practiced in China, the US and Europe by all people over 35-40 years for over half a century. All patients there know about the necessity of cleansing the blood vessels. I kept asking myself all the time why this doesn&apos;t happen in our country as well.</p>
<p>*Are there any symptoms which make us realize about the presence of deposits in the blood vessels?</p>
<p>*The main symptoms are:</p>
<p>Migraines,</p>
<p>Memory impairments,</p>
<p>Chronic fatigue,</p>
<p>Insomnia,</p>
<p>Amnesia, depression,Poor</p>
<p>Eyesight and hearing disorders</p>
<p>High blood pressure,</p>
<p>Breathing impairments and angina pectoris</p>
<p>Pale skin, legs</p>
<p>Muscle and joint pain.</p>
<p>Regardless if you have one of these symptoms or not, after the age of 30, it is necessary to cleanse the blood vessels at least once yearly. This way, you will have a strong health.</p>
<p>The blood vessels have the capacity of gathering impurities, especially in older people. For this, it is not necessary to eat burgers or French fries all day long. Even after eating a sausage or a fried egg, a certain amount of cholesterol will deposit in the blood cells, which, in time, will increase.</p>
